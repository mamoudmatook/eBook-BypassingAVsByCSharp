Warning :Don't Use "www.virustotal.com" or something like that , Never Ever ;D

Recommended:

STEP 1 : Use each AV one by one in your LAB .

STEP 2 : after "AV Signature Database Updated" your Internet Connection should be "Disconnect" .

STEP 3 : Now you can Copy and Paste your C# code to your Virtual Machine for test .

(some AVs will Dump/Upload your Codes/Exe to Their Servers for Analysis)
